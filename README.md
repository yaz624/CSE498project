Project Summary:
----------------
This project aims to automate the generation of pixel-style characters for games using a Conditional Deep Convolutional GAN (cDCGAN) model.

Traditionally, pixel art creation is manual and time-consuming. Our system enables users to generate diverse pixel characters (Monster, Human, Item, Equipment) by selecting a random seed and character type through a simple web interface.

Project Features:
-----------------
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle Pixel Art Characters (16x16 pixels, 89,000+ images).
- Generator conditioned on character types for controlled output.
- Deployed via Streamlit for user interaction and feedback collection.
- Feedback automatically saved to a Google Sheet via API.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
- backend/: Model training, generator code, and deployment utilities.
- frontend/: HTML, CSS, and JS files for web interface.
- dataset/: Dataset containing pixel character images.
- static/: Generated images storage.
- feedback/: Collected user feedback.

Software Requirements:
-----------------------
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Flask
- Streamlit
- gspread
- google-auth
- numpy
- PIL (pillow)

How to Run Locally:
-------------------
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaz624/CSE498project/tree/master

streamlit run app.py --server.fileWatcherType none
```
or
```bash
python run.py
```
2.Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Or manually install: pip install torch torchvision flask streamlit gspread google-auth pillow numpy)

3.Prepare Dataset:

Download dataset (see data/readme_data.txt).

Place into dataset/pixel_art_data/.

4.Train or Load Model:

If training: run backend/train.py

If using pre-trained: ensure checkpoint in checkpoints/generator_epoch_460.pth

5.Run the Application:

For local Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

6.Deployment:

Deploy Streamlit app to Streamlit Community Cloud for public access.

Connect to Google Sheet via service account JSON key.
